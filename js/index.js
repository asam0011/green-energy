This, in turn, causes the mercury vapor to give off ultraviolet light, which stimulates the phosphorous coating on the inside the glass tubes to produce visible light.Each low energy light bulb used to replace a traditional bulb saves around 2000 times its own weight in carbon dioxide emissions over the course of its life, which is generally 5-8 years. Thatâ€™s of incredible benefit to the environment.',

The global weighted-average levelized cost of hydropower electricity was equal to or below the cost of the cheapest fossil fuel-fired alternative in all but two years between 2010 and 2018. Subsequently, the majority of the hydropower used between 2010 and 2018 has cost less than the cheapest fossil fuel option.',

Photovoltaic (PV) energy is created by using flat solar panels that can be affixed to a structures roof or arrayed across open spaces. According to EnergySage, homeowners in Washington will save $17,173 to $23,234, if they go solar over a 20-year period, based on 2019 costs for a 5 kW system.',
